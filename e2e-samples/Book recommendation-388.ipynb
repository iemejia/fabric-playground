The scenario is to build a book recommendation system for the users based on their preferences.\n","\n","A recommendation system is a class of machine learning algorithms that offers relevant suggestions to the user. Considering a user's past preferences or ratings, a recommendation system would suggest new items to the user that could include movies to watch, books to read, products to buy, etc. Several types of recommendation algorithms exist, but in this notebook you use a model-based collaborative filtering algorithm called **Alternating Least Squares (ALS) matrix factorization**.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://negustpublicblob.blob.core.windows.net/public/recommenders.png\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n","\n","ALS attempts to estimate a ratings matrix $R$ as a product of two lower-rank matrices known as \"factor\" matrices such that $R = U^T V$  where $U$ and $V$ can be called user and item matrix, respectively. The general approach is iterative and during each iteration, one of the factor matrices is held constant, while the other is solved using the least squares. Applying this approach alternately to the matrices $U$ and $V$ is guaranteed to monotonically decrease the overall cost function and hence you can iteratively improve the matrix factorization.\n","\n","<img src=\"https://negustpublicblob.blob.core.windows.net/public/Matrixfactor.svg\" style=\"width:600px;\"/>\n","\n","<br/><br/>\n","\n","Please note that this notebook can be modified to use custom data by adjusting certain parameters that will be discussed below. \n","\n","The summary of the main steps you take in this notebook are as following:\n","\n","1. Load the data\n","2. Understand and process the data using exploratory data analysis\n","3. Train a machine learning model using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) model and track experiments using MLflow and Fabric Autologging feature\n","4. Save the final machine learning model and load it for scoring and making predictions\n","\n","## Prerequisites\n","- Have a lakehouse added to this notebook.
